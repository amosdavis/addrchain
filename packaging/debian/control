Description: Blockchain-based network address management
 addrchain replaces DHCP with a decentralized blockchain ledger for
 self-assignable IPv4, IPv6, and POOL 256-bit network addresses.
 Includes a Linux kernel module (via DKMS), userspace daemon (addrd),
 and CLI tool (addrctl). Supports VPN tunnel management (WireGuard,
 IPsec, POOL), subnet creation, and network partitioning.
